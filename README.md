# bashScripts
This is a collection of Bash scripts that I use to manipulate files, submit jobs, and automate measurements for lattice QCD. These include:

-bashTools.bash: Some colors and error handing Bash functions.
-comments.bash: A script for making header comments in a consistent way.
-concatenateFiles.bash: A script to combine output files into one file in a human-readable way.
